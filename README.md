# Branch info

All stable versions will be added in the stable branch, to see current code see the workingBranch where the latest code will be 
put. Note workingBranch and the stable branch isn't the final versions of code and will be subject to optimisation and refactoring. 
The master branch (here) will contain "final" code, which should be heavily vetted. If the master branch is empty then the code
isn't in it's finalised form.
