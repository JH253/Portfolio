# Branch info

All stable versions will be added here, if it is blank then currently all projects are work in progress, to see current
code see the workingBranch where the latest code will be put. Note workingBranch and the stable branch isn't the final 
versions of code and will be subject to optimisation and refactoring. The master branch will contain "final" code, which
should be heavily vetted.
