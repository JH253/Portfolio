# Portfolio
## Structure:

This portfolio is split into several main directories, each of which is focused arround a programming language which would be the 
main language that project is written in. Due to web development being particularly pollygotic that folder will be named "web 
development".

Each directory has it's own README that will guide you through. 

## Branch info:
All stable versions will be added in the stable branch, all current code (work in progress) is in the workingBranch (here) where 
the  latest code will be put. Note workingBranch and the stable branch isn't the final versions of code and will be subject to 
optimisation and refactoring. The master branch will contain "final" code, which should be heavily vetted.
